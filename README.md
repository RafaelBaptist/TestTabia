# Regarding the tablE

- I chose to make the table in a simple way, without actually using 'REACT TABLE', which would make it easier to create it. That way, i was able to show my skills/ comprehension in a better form.

# Regarding the Userstate and the Usereffect (react hooks)

- I used react hooks because it makes it easier to mantain the state of the isolated component. Since there wouldn't be a rendering overload, I thought it would be the most valid action to take.

# Regarding the "Foreach"

- Because it is an easy, simple and little on data function, I chose to use it instead of more complex methods like 'reduce', for example.

# Conclusion

- On this project, I chose to focus on aspects such as simplicity, maintainability and user experience. The use of React, Typescript and CSS is really beneficial due to its capacity to improve readability, reusability and automatic updating of the interface.
